# FavorITe
Sencha Touch web app with Spring Boot back-end

FavorITe is your favorite app to ask for and complete favors. Running late to class and need someone to get you your favorite Starbucks coffee? Or need a waffle at night but too lazy to go get one yourself? Worry not, just Favor IT!

The app's back-end isn't fully done yet but you can still run the app. Here are the steps:
1. From your command prompt, cd into the FavorITe-Sencha Touch folder and run the command "sencha web start".
2. Now, cd into the FavorITe-web-services folder and run "mvn spring-boot:run".
3. Once the server has started, go to "http://localhost:1841/" on your web browser and voila, start favoring!
