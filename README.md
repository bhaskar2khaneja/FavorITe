# FavorITe
Sencha Touch web app with Spring Boot back-end

FavorITe is your favorite app to ask for and complete favors. Running late to class and need someone to get you your favorite Starbucks coffee? Or need a waffle at night but too lazy to go get one yourself? Worry not, just Favor IT!

The app's back-end is still in the making but you may still be able to run part of it.
